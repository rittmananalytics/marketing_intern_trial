# Introduction

This trial project simulates real-world working conditions as a marketing intern as closely as possible by:
- Covering the end-to-end process of developing and executing a social media and email marketing campaign
- Using services, data, and tools similar to or the same as we use on marketing campaigns
- Providing practical deliverables to evaluate your marketing and strategic thinking.

## What are trial projects?

Trial projects are short (4-6 hours), fully-paid projects designed to resemble the work you would do at Rittman Analytics. The deliverables are for evaluative purposes only and are not used for our actual marketing efforts. We pay £14.50/hour (£87) for a six-hour trial, paid within 30 days to your PayPal email or UK bank account.

Please note that we typically have multiple candidates completing trial projects. Performance on the trial informs decisions about proceeding to the next stage, though there is no guarantee of a permanent offer.

Trial projects are designed to be challenging, so don’t worry if you find it difficult to finish everything within the specified time. Just prioritize accordingly and give it your best effort.

## Guidance Notes

- Please spend no more than a total of 6 hours on this trial.
- If you don't finish within those 6 hours, please submit what you have completed.
- If you have questions along the way, feel free to ask.
- Please summarize your campaign proposal in a Google Slides deck that’s publicly viewable and share the link via TeamTailor.
- Provide your PayPal email using TeamTailor when submitting your campaign proposal so that we can pay you for your time.

# Project Specification

Your task is to create a marketing campaign that uses social media to publicize a free, interactive scorecard web application that helps a decision-maker within a business understand their readiness to adopt Generative AI, then uses a follow-up automated email sequence that aims to convert leads captured by the scorecard app into booked sales meetings.

We want to run this campaign on LinkedIn or another B2B platform to target decision-makers in relevant industries and geographies; assume Hubspot, Mailchimp or a similar email marketing services would be used for the automated email follow-up.

The campaign should:
- Run for one week
- Raise awareness of the need for businesses to plan their approach to Generative AI and assess their current readiness using this web application
- Leverage current trends in Generative AI and the contents of the scorecard and our website to increase engagement
- Have the initial objective of collecting leads through the scorecard, and the second objective of converting those leads into meeting bookings to discuss our Generative AI services

## What We Are Looking For in Terms of Deliverables

1. **Target Audience & Key Messages**
   - Identify the target audience for the campaign (e.g., CIOs, CTOs, Data Scientists).
   - Define the primary message and secondary messages for each post, ensuring alignment with the goal of generating completions of the scorecard app.

2. **Campaign Schedule**
   - Develop a detailed schedule for a week-long campaign.
   - Outline the content, messaging, and posting frequency across LinkedIn or your chosen platform.
   - Include rationale for the scheduling strategy and timing.
   - Detail any follow-up messaging or other means you might use to drive engagement and completion of the web app.
   - Create a email sequence to convert those leads into meeting bookings

3. **Mock Posts**
   - Create 1-2 mock posts using Google Slides or Canva, including both copy and visuals.
   - These posts should promote the benefits of the "Discover Your Readiness for GenAI adoption" scorecard app and provide a clear CTA.
  
5. **Lead Conversion**
   - Develop a sequence of 3 mock marketing emails that would be sent to each lead captured by the scorecard app, including both copy and visuals.
   - These emails can make use of data entered by the lead into the scorecard app, and have the goal of converting the lead into a meeting booking to discuss the outcome of the scorecard and our Gen AI services.

6. **Incorporating Industry Trends**
   - Research and incorporate recent digital marketing, social media, and industry trends to maximize engagement.
   - Suggest how these can be integrated into the campaign to drive conversations and increase visibility.

7. **Performance Metrics**
   - Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) that should be tracked to measure the success of the campaign (e.g., CTR, lead generation, engagement and conversion rates).
