## Marketing Campaign Brief

### Introduction

This trial project simulates real-world working conditions as a marketing intern as closely as possible by:
- Covering the end-to-end process of developing and executing a marketing campaign
- Using services, data, and tools similar to those we use on our actual marketing campaigns
- Providing practical deliverables to evaluate your marketing and strategic thinking.

### What are trial projects?

Trial projects are short (4-6 hours), fully-paid projects designed to resemble the work you would do at Rittman Analytics. The deliverables are for evaluative purposes only and are not used for our actual marketing efforts. We pay £14.50/hour (£87) for a six-hour trial, paid within 30 days to your PayPal email or UK bank account.

Please note that we typically have multiple candidates completing trial projects. Performance on the trial informs decisions about proceeding to the next stage, though there is no guarantee of a permanent offer.

Trial projects are designed to be challenging, so don’t worry if you find it difficult to finish everything within the specified time. Prioritize accordingly and give it your best effort.

### Guidance Notes

- Please spend no more than a total of 6 hours on this trial.
- If you don't finish within those 6 hours, submit what you have completed.
- If you have questions along the way, feel free to ask.
- Summarize your campaign proposal in a Google Slides deck that’s publicly viewable and share the link via TeamTailor.
- Provide your PayPal email using TeamTailor when submitting your campaign proposal so that we can pay you for your time.

## Project Specification

### The Business Problem

Rittman Analytics has developed a **free, interactive scorecard web application** to help businesses assess their readiness to adopt **Generative AI**. This tool is designed to assist decision-makers in evaluating where their organization stands in terms of AI capabilities and identifying steps to improve their AI readiness.

Despite the growing interest in AI and the value the scorecard offers, we are facing a challenge in generating sufficient awareness and engagement from our target audience, particularly in terms of driving **completions of the scorecard** and **converting leads into sales meetings**.

We need to build a marketing campaign that effectively reaches and engages the right decision-makers in key industries, encourages them to complete the scorecard, and then converts those leads into meetings with our sales team to discuss our AI-related services.

### Your Task

Design a marketing campaign that addresses the business problem outlined above and utilizes the digital channels we commonly use at Rittman Analytics. The campaign should aim to:

1. **Raise awareness** of the importance of businesses assessing their readiness to adopt Generative AI.
2. **Drive engagement** with the scorecard tool, encouraging decision-makers to complete the assessment.
3. **Convert leads** captured by the scorecard into booked meetings to discuss our Generative AI services.

### Deliverables

1. **Campaign Strategy**
   - Identify the **target audience** (e.g., specific job titles, industries, company sizes).
   - Define the **core messaging** that will resonate with this audience and drive them to complete the scorecard.
   - Outline how you plan to use the digital channels available (e.g., LinkedIn, email, website) to promote the scorecard and generate leads.

2. **Campaign Plan**
   - Propose a detailed campaign plan, including the digital channels, content strategy, and frequency of engagement (posts, emails, etc.).
   - Include ideas for **social media posts**, **email marketing sequences**, and any **landing page** suggestions you think will optimize the conversion process.

3. **Lead Conversion Tactics**
   - Describe how you will nurture leads captured through the scorecard and convert them into booked meetings. This can include a series of follow-up emails, retargeting ads, or other marketing automation techniques.

4. **Industry Trends and Best Practices**
   - Research and incorporate current trends in digital marketing and Generative AI adoption to ensure the campaign is relevant, engaging, and timely.

5. **Performance Metrics**
   - Propose key performance indicators (KPIs) to track throughout the campaign. These could include metrics such as engagement rates, lead conversion rates, or scorecard completion rates.

### Digital Channels & Tools Available

We primarily use the following channels and tools for our campaigns:
- **LinkedIn**: Our main platform for B2B engagement and content distribution.
- **Email Marketing**: HubSpot or Mailchimp to automate follow-up email sequences.
- **Website & Landing Pages**: Hosting and promoting content through our website, including blogs and lead-generation tools.
  
Feel free to suggest additional channels or strategies you think would be effective based on the target audience and business problem.
