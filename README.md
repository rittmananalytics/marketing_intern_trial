# Introduction

This trial project simulates real-world working conditions as a marketing intern as closely as possible by:
- Covering the end-to-end process of developing and executing a social media campaign
- Using services, data and tools similar to or the same as we use on marketing campaigns
- Providing practical deliverables to evaluate your marketing and strategic thinking.

## What are trial projects?

Trial projects are short (4-6 hours), fully-paid projects designed to resemble the work you would do at Rittman Analytics. The deliverables are for evaluative purposes only and are not used for our actual marketing efforts. We pay £14.50/hour (£87) for a six-hour trial within 30 days to your PayPal email or UK bank account.

Please note that we typically have multiple candidates completing trial projects. Performance on the trial informs decisions about proceeding to the next stage of the process, though there is no guarantee of a permanent offer.

Trial projects are designed to be challenging, so don’t worry if you find it difficult to finish everything within the specified time. Just prioritize accordingly and give it your best effort.

## Guidance Notes

- Please spend no more than a total of 6 hours on this trial.
- If you don't finish within those 6 hours, please submit what you have completed.
- If you have questions along the way, feel free to ask.
- Please summarize your campaign proposal in a Google Slides deck that’s publicly viewable and share the link.
- Provide your PayPal email in the Google Doc for payment purposes.

We want to run this campaing on LinkedIn or another B2B platform to target decision-makers in relevant industries and geographies.

The campaign should:
- Run for one week
- Raise awareness of the need for businesses to plan their approach to Generative AI and to assess their current readiness using this web application
- Leverage current trends in Generative AI and the contents of the scorecard and our website to increase engagement

## What We Are Looking For in Terms of Deliverables

1. **Target Audience & Key Messages**
   - Identify the target audience for the campaign (e.g., CIOs, CTOs, Data Scientists).
   - Define the primary message and secondary messages for each post, ensuring alignment with the goal of generating completions of the scorecard app.

2. **Campaign Schedule**
   - Develop a detailed schedule for a week-long campaign.
   - Outline the content, messaging, and posting frequency across LinkedIn or your chosen platform.
   - Include rationale for the scheduling strategy and timing.
   - Outline any follow-up messaging or other means you might use to drive engagement and completion of the web app.

3. **Mock Posts**
   - Create 1-2 mock posts with copy and visuals. The visuals can be simple (you may use tools like Canva or Google Slides for this purpose).
   - These posts should promote the benefits of the "Discover Your Readiness for GenAI adoption" scorecard app and and provide a clear CTA.

4. **Incorporating Industry Trends**
   - Research and incorporate recent digital marketing, social media and industrty trends to maximize engagement.
   - Suggest how these can be integrated into the campaign to drive conversations and increase visibility.

5. **Performance Metrics**
